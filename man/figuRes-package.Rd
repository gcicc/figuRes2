This package takes the view that a figure is a collection of graphs/tables assembled on a page and optionally annotated with metadata (titles, headers and footers). The steps to figure building can then be chunked as follows:

1. Data importation
2. Data pre-processing
3. Graph/table building (with subsequent processing necessary)
4. Assembling graph/tables on a page
5. Optional annotation to complete the figure

The figuRes package provides a suite of functions for producing harmonized figures using the ggplot2 packages. Additional ggplot themes are included. The package provides functions to assist with assembling multiple graphics on a page and annotating the page with headers and footnotes.  Functions to facilitate data processing and mass figure production are included.  Data sets are included to demonstrate how the functions work and this document contains a section that walks through the workflow for large scale figure production.

All graphing functions in this package presume a data.frame is supplied with a specific data structure.  In practice these can be either imported (e.g., as a .csv file) or generated with R (e.g., output of simulation or call to a probability distirbution function).

Data pre-processing of imported files may be required to ensure the data.frames are organized properly, factors are properly organized and labeled appropriatel, etc. To handle this, the user may wish to author functions to assist with this pre-processing. The demog.data data set and related process.bslchar function provide an example. 

The the build.page function is designed to help visualize how graphics are organized on a page, as well as execute the task. The graphics passed to this function can be created with the functions in this package or by the user. With the former, keep in mind that these are merely functions that facilitate the construction of ggplot objects. 

In the simplest case a figure will consist of a single graphic.

Some figures call for augmenting a graphic with a table (e.g., forest plots, Kaplan-Meier curves). In these cases, the tables are built using either table.plot or nsubj.plot (or again, the user coded ggplot text table). In the case of Kaplan-Meier curves, it is standard practice to arrange the KM curve on top of a table reporting the Number at Risk. Other figures call for juxtaposing two figures. In these cases, the task is either to arrange 2 graphics in a 1 (row) x 2 (col) or a 2 x 1 grid. More generally, the task is to arrange a dashboard of graphics/tables on an nrow x ncol grid and place them on page with predefined margins.

Once the individual graphs/tables have been created for a figure, pre-processing may be required. E.g., there may be a need to align the y-axes when stacking graphics: if Graph A has the longest y-axis tick label, Graph B will need to be adjusted so graphics are aligned when arranging them on a 2 x 1 grid.

When the collection of graphs/tables have been pre-processed, they can be passed to the build.page function. This function requires the user to specify how the row widths and column heights should be specified as well as the order in which to populate the cells of the grid of graphics.

The defaults presume figures are being displayed on an 8.5 inch x 11 inch page, with landscape orientation and margins of 1.5 inches at the top and bottom and 1 inch margins at the left and right. These dimensions provide sufficient room for 2 lines of headers, 4 lines of footnotes and a effective central region for graphs and tables of size (8.5 - 3) inch x (11 - 2) inch.  Generalizing from the defaults is straightforward.  Trial and error will be required to fine tune aesthetic aspects. 

The function annotate.page has been coded to optionally populate with blank entries (helpful when building graphics that don't require annotation and where margins are minimized), dummy entries (helpful in developement phases) or entries coming from a data.frame called outputplan (helpful for mass figure production).
